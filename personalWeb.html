            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="indent white-text">
                <p>I am a passionate Machine Learning Research Engineer intern, currently working at Ivy, an open-source framework similar to TensorFlow, MXNet, Keras, Numpy, PaddlePaddle, and others.</p>
                <p>In addition to my work at Ivy, I am currently contributing to a project on Wikipedia, led by Grey-Box. This project involves tasks such as translating, comparing articles for discrepancies, and more. 
                It is a significant initiative with a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP).</p>
                <p>I earned my degree in Computer Science from the University at Albany, NY in May 2023. Before that, I transferred to Albany in 2019 with an Associate degree in Engineering Science from Tompkins Cortland Community College in Dryden, NY.</p>
                <p>My professional journey is driven by a deep fascination for machine learning, cybersecurity, and web development. I am constantly exploring the cutting edge of technology and am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in these fields.</p>
                <p>Let's embark on a quest to innovate and make a mark in the world of tech together.</p>

                <h3>Project Title 1: ML Competition - Open-Problem: Single - Cell Perturbations </h3>
                <p>In the fast-paced world of single-cell analysis, the Kaggle competition titled "Open Problem: Single-Cell Perturbations" 
                    plays a vital role. This research paper outlines the goals of the competition and underscores its importance in enhancing 
                    our comprehension of how genes react to experimental changes at the single-cell level. A key method used in this competition 
                    is Differential Expression (DE) Modeling, which allows us to calculate alterations in gene expression when subjected 
                    to perturbations. <a href="https://machinelearner1.blogspot.com/2023/10/machine-learning-project.html" download>It can be found here.</a>

                <h3>Project Title 2: Simplified Ivy's Documentaions for New Contributors</h3>
                <p> While familiarizing myself with Ivy's documentation and codebase during the onboarding process, I recognized the need 
                    for a concise manual tailored to new contributors. This "proposed guide simply" emphasizes crucial sections, facilitating a seamless 
                    transition into the Ivy ecosystem. <a href="Simple-Guide-ToNew-Ivy-Contributors.pdf" download>Click on</a> 
                    to download a copy. (Please note the guide is being examined by Ivy engineers).

                <h3>Project Title 3: Adversarial Attacks on Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems</h3>
                <p> This is another proposed research topic under consideration. This proposed topic, attempts to explore how adversarial 
                    attacks can be used to bypass machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDS). Develop and test novel techniques 
                    to enhance the robustness of IDS against adversarial examples, ultimately leading to more secure detection of network intrusions.<!--project portfolio -->
