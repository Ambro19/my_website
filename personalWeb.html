            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="indent white-text">
                <p>I'm a passionate Machine Learning Research Engineer intern currently working at Ivy, an open-source framework akin to TensorFlow, MXNet, Keras, etc.
                In May 2023, I earned my degree in Computer Science from the University at Albany, NY, after transferring there in 2019 with 
                an Associate degree in Engineering Science from Tompkins Cortland Community College in Dryden, NY.</p> 
                <p>My professional journey is fueled by a deep fascination for machine learning, cybersecurity, and web development. I thrive 
                on exploring the cutting edge of technology, and I'm dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in these fields.</p>
                <p>Join me on my quest to innovate and make a mark in the world of tech.

                <h3>Project Title 1: Simplified Ivy's Documentaions for New Contributors</h3>
                <p>While familiarizing myself with Ivy's documentation and codebase during the onboarding process, I recognized the need 
                   for a concise manual tailored to new contributors. This guide emphasizes crucial sections, facilitating a seamless 
                   transition into the Ivy ecosystem. Please click <a href="Simple-Guide-ToNew-Ivy-Contributors.pdf" download>Download PDF</a> 
                   to download a copy of my guide. PS: The guide is being examined by Ivy engineers.

                <h3>Project Title 2: "Enhancing Natural Language Processing with Syntactic Parsing: Uniting CYK (Cocke–Younger–Kasami) Algorithm and Deep Learning Techniques.</h3>
                <p> This is my proposed research paper submitted to Ivy for consideration. This proposed paper captures the idea of combining the 
                    CYK algorithm, a fundamental tool in automata theory for parsing context-free grammars, with advanced deep learning methods in 
                    the context of natural language processing. It reflects the potential for cross-disciplinary insights that could lead to significant 
                    advancements in both automata study and machine learning research.

                <h3>Project Title 3: Adversarial Attacks on Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems</h3>
                <p> This is another proposed research topic under consideration. This proposed topic, attempts to explore how adversarial 
                    attacks can be used to bypass machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDS). Develop and test novel techniques 
                    to enhance the robustness of IDS against adversarial examples, ultimately leading to more secure detection of network intrusions.
