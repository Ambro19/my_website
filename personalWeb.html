            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="indent white-text">
                <p>I'm a passionate Machine Learning Research Engineer intern currently working at Ivy, an open-source framework akin to TensorFlow, MXNet, Keras, etc.
                In May 2023, I earned my degree in Computer Science from the University at Albany, NY, after transferring there in 2019 with 
                an Associate degree in Engineering Science from Tompkins Cortland Community College in Dryden, NY.</p> 
                <p>My professional journey is fueled by a deep fascination for machine learning, cybersecurity, and web development. I thrive 
                on exploring the cutting edge of technology, and I'm dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in these fields.</p>
                <p>Let us join on the quest to innovate and make a mark in the world of tech.

                <h3>Project Title 1: ML Competition - Open-Problem: Single - Cell Perturbations </h3>
                <p>In the fast-paced world of single-cell analysis, the Kaggle competition titled "Open Problem: Single-Cell Perturbations" 
                    plays a vital role. This research paper outlines the goals of the competition and underscores its importance in enhancing 
                    our comprehension of how genes react to experimental changes at the single-cell level. A key method used in this competition 
                    is Differential Expression (DE) Modeling, which allows us to calculate alterations in gene expression when subjected 
                    to perturbations. <a href="https://machinelearner1.blogspot.com/2023/10/machine-learning-project.html" download>It can be found here.</a>

                <h3>Project Title 2: Simplified Ivy's Documentaions for New Contributors</h3>
                <p> While familiarizing myself with Ivy's documentation and codebase during the onboarding process, I recognized the need 
                    for a concise manual tailored to new contributors. This "proposed guide simply" emphasizes crucial sections, facilitating a seamless 
                    transition into the Ivy ecosystem. <a href="Simple-Guide-ToNew-Ivy-Contributors.pdf" download>Click on</a> 
                    to download a copy. (Please note the guide is being examined by Ivy engineers).

                <h3>Project Title 3: Adversarial Attacks on Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems</h3>
                <p> This is another proposed research topic under consideration. This proposed topic, attempts to explore how adversarial 
                    attacks can be used to bypass machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDS). Develop and test novel techniques 
                    to enhance the robustness of IDS against adversarial examples, ultimately leading to more secure detection of network intrusions.
