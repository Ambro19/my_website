        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="indent white-text">
                <p>I earned my degree in Computer Science from the University at Albany, NY in May 2023. Before that, I transferred to Albany in 2019 with an Associate degree in Engineering Science from Tompkins Cortland Community College in Dryden, NY.</p>
                <p>I am a passionate Machine Learning Research Engineer intern, currently working at Ivy, an open-source framework similar to TensorFlow, MXNet, Keras, Numpy, PaddlePaddle, and others.</p>
                <p>In addition to my work at Ivy, I am currently contributing to a project on Wikipedia, led by Grey-Box. This project involves tasks such as translating, comparing articles for discrepancies, and more. 
                It is a significant initiative with a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP), using DeepL Translator (draws from Lingueeâ€™s massive corpus of manually translated sentences, idioms and text snippets.) and Google Cloud Translate (uses a mix 
                    of digital resources in various languages) as machine learning translation services. </p>
                <p>My professional journey is driven by a deep fascination for machine learning, cybersecurity, and web development. I am constantly exploring the cutting edge of technology and am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in these fields.</p>
                <p>Let's embark on a quest to innovate and make a mark in the world of tech together.</p>

                <h3>Project Title 1: Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users</h3>
                <p>If you were to inquire about someone's ideal home, they likely wouldn't start by discussing basement ceiling height or the distance to an 
                    east-west railroad. </p>
                <p>However, the dataset for this competition demonstrates that factors beyond the quantity of bedrooms or the presence 
                of a white-picket fence significantly impact price negotiations. </p>
                <p>Featuring 79 descriptive variables covering nearly every facet of residential properties in Ames, Iowa, this challenge invites participants 
                to forecast the ultimate price of each home.</p>

                        It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset.</p>

                    <h3>Evaluation</h3><p></p>
                        <h3>Goal</h3>
                            <p>It is the competiting student's job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, the competiting student must predict the
                            value of the SalePrice variable.

                <section>
                    <h3>Metric</h3>
                        <p>Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and 
                        the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and
                       cheap houses will affect the result equally.)
